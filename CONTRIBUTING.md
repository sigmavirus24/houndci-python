## Developing

Requires Python 3.4.

Run `bin/setup` to get dependencies.

Run tests with `py.test`.

## Making a difference

1. Fork the repo.

1. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
   to know that you have a clean slate: `py.test`

1. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!

1. Make the test pass.

1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love tests!
